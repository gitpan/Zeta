Zeta

A basic app and web-app set of modules that have proven useful over the years.
Not quite enough to call it a framework, but has been the underpinning of 
several utilities and web applications throughout the years.

While previous versions were released as part of other packages, programs,
or code in other projects, it was never released directly on CPAN. I'm 
reviewing the code and pulling it together for CPAN release in the Zeta module.
